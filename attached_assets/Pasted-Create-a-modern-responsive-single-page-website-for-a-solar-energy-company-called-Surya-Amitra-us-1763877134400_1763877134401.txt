Create a modern, responsive, single-page website for a solar energy company called "Surya Amitra" using only HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript (no frameworks). The design should be inspired by the "Zolar – Solar Energy WordPress Theme" (clean, professional, green/amber solar-themed with bold sections, cards, and clear CTAs).

Use the following content:
- Main headline: "Powering a Sustainable Future"
- Subheading: "Reliable & Affordable Solar Energy Solutions"
- Description: "Switch to solar and reduce your electricity bills while helping the environment. We provide high-quality solar panels and professional installation services for homes and businesses."
- Hero image URL: https://www.suryaamitra.com/assets/images/solar_image.jpg

Structure the page with:
1. A sticky header with the logo (use "Surya Amitra" as text) and navigation links: Home, Services, Projects, Contact.
2. A full-width hero section with the headline, subheading, description, a "Get Free Quote" button, and the solar image as a background (with dark overlay for readability).
3. A "Services" section with 3–4 service cards (e.g., Residential Solar, Commercial Solar, Installation & Maintenance) using icons or simple placeholders.
4. A "Why Choose Us" section with 3–4 benefit points (e.g., 10+ Years Experience, Affordable EMI, 25-Year Warranty, Certified Experts).
5. A "Projects" section showing a simple 2x2 grid of project placeholders using the same solar image.
6. A "Contact CTA" section with a centered headline "Ready to Go Solar?" and a "Schedule Free Assessment" button.
7. A footer with copyright, contact info (use placeholder: contact@suryaamitra.com | +91 XXXXXXXXXX), and social media icons (as placeholders).

Design requirements:
- Use a solar-themed color palette: greens (#2E7D32 or #388E3C), amber/orange (#FF6F00 or #FF8F00), white, and dark gray.
- Fully responsive (mobile-friendly).
- Clean, modern typography (use Google Fonts like 'Poppins' or 'Open Sans').
- Smooth hover effects on buttons and cards.
- No external dependencies except Google Fonts and Font Awesome (for icons via CDN).
- All code in one HTML file (inline CSS and minimal JS if needed).

Make it functional, fast, and visually aligned with professional solar energy websites like the Zolar theme.
